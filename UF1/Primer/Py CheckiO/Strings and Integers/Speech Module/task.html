    Stephen's speech module is broken.
    This module is responsible for his number pronunciation.
    He has to click to input all of the numerical digits in a figure,
    so when there are big numbers it can take him a long time.
    Help the robot to speak properly and increase his number processing speed by writing a new speech module for him.
    All the words in the string must be separated by exactly one space character.
    Be careful with spaces - it's hard to see if you place two spaces instead one.

<p><strong>Input:</strong> An integer <span translate="no">(int)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> A string <span translate="no">(str)</span>.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert checkio(1) == &quot;one&quot;
assert checkio(2) == &quot;two&quot;
assert checkio(3) == &quot;three&quot;
assert checkio(4) == &quot;four&quot;
</pre>
</div>

<strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This concept may be useful for the speech synthesis software or automatic reports systems.
    This system can also be used when writing a chatbot by assigning words or phrases numerical
    values and having a system retrieve responses based on those values.

<p><strong>Precondition:</strong>0 &lt; number &lt; 1000</p>
