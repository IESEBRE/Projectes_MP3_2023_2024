<h2>Multiply (Intro)</h2>
<p>This is an intro mission, the purpose of which is to explain how to solve missions on CheckiO. If you want to know how to get the maximum out of using CheckiO, check out our blog post <a href="https://py.checkio.org/blog/checkio-intro-full-version-from-basic-to-advance-u/">"From Basic to Advance usage"</a>.</p>
<p>This mission is the easiest one. Write a function that will receive 2 numbers as input and it should return the multiplication of these 2 numbers.</p>
<p>
<strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments. Both are of type <span translate="repeat">int</span>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Output:</strong> <span translate="repeat">Int</span>. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">assert mult_two(3, 2) == 6
assert mult_two(0, 1) == 0
</pre>
<p>A series of hints below will help you to understand how to solve the mission. Start the series by clicking on "I donâ€™t know how to solve that mission."</p>
