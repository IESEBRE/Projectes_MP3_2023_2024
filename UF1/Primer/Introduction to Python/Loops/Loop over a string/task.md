## Loop over a string

As we discussed earlier, strings in Python are in many ways similar to lists. 
You can iterate over a string just like you would iterate over a list.  
  
Use a loop to count how many characters `hello_world` contains. Store 
this number in the variable `length`.  

<div class='hint'>Use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate over the <code>hello_world</code> string.</div>
