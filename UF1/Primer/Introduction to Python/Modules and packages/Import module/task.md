## Import module

As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for 
easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that youâ€™ve written 
in several programs without copying its definition into each of them.

Modules in Python are simply Python files with the `.py` extension containing 
Python definitions and statements.
Modules are imported from other modules using the `import` keyword 
and the file name without the extension `.py`. 

Let's say you wrote a script called `my_funcs.py` with a bunch of functions (`func1`, `func2`, 
etc.). Now, if you want to use those in another script that is placed in the same directory, 
you can do `import my_funcs`. This does not import the names of the functions defined in `my_funcs` 
directly, but using the module name, you can now access the functions, for example:
```python
my_funcs.func1()
```

Modules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place all 
import statements at the beginning of a module.

You can find out more about modules in Python by reading [this section](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) of The Python Tutorial. 
  
In the code editor, import the module `calculator` and create an instance of the class `Calculator` (`calc`). 
Use the `add` method defined in `Calculator` in a loop to add up numbers from 0 to 99.

<div class='hint'>Use the <code>import</code> keyword and the <code>calculator</code> reference.</div>
<div class='hint'>Access the function from the module using syntax such as <code>module.function()</code>.</div>
<div class="hint">Don't forget to provide the function with an argument.</div>
