## Add dictionary items from lists

We defined two lists and an empty dictionary for you. Your task is to 
iterate over the lists using a [`for` loop](course://Loops/For loop) and add key:value pairs of
the corresponding list items (key1: 100, key2: 200, key3: 300) to the dictionary.
The `for` statement is already written, you only need to write the assignment that will occur for 
each key:value pair. 

<div class="hint">

Make use of list indexing such as `list_name[index]` and dictionary indexing such as `dict[key] = value` for value assignment.
