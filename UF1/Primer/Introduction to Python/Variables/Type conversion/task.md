## Type conversion

There are several built-in functions that let you convert one data type into another. 
These functions return a new object representing the converted value. `int(x)` 
converts `x` into an integer. `float(x)` converts `x` into a floating-point number. `str(x)` 
converts object `x` into a string representation.  
### Task
Convert `float_number` into an integer.
