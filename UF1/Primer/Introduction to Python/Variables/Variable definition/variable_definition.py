# We'll explain the expression str(a) later in the course.
# For now: it is used to convert the variable "a" into a string.
print("a = " + str(a))

# Assign "greetings" to the variable using the assignment operator

# This is called a "chained assignment". It assigns the value 2 to variables "a" and "b".
a # Assign 2 to both a and b here 2
