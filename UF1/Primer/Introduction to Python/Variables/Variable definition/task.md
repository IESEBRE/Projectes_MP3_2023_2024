## Variable definition

Variables are used to store values so we can refer to them later. A variable 
is like a label, and in Python we use the ' `=` ' symbol, known as the 
assignment operator, to assign a value to a variable. An assignment can be 
chained, e.g., `a = b = 2`.   
### Task
 - Change the value stored in the variable `greetings`.
 - Use the chain assignment to store 2 in both `a` and `b` on line 15.

<div class="hint">Type a new value in the answer placeholder.</div>
