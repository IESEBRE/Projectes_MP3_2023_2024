## Undefined variable

Variable names may only contain Latin letters, digits, and/or the underscore 
character, and they cannot start with a digit. They also cannot be any of the 
reserved <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords">keywords</a>.
### Task
Check what happens if you use a variable which is not defined yet. Change and run the code in the editor â€“ try to print out an undefined name.  
This should cause an exception - a `NameError`.

Note, that "check" command only runs the testing system, and you will not see the output, so you need to run the file.

<div class="hint">Type the name of an undefined variable inside the brackets of the <code>print</code> statement. 
Note that variable names must start with a letter and can contain only letters, '_', and numbers.</div>
