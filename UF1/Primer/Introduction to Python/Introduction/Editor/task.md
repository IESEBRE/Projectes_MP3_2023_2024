## Editor

The <b>Editor</b> is your playground where you will be programming. You can experiment here while you work on theoretical tasks and quizzes without being checked.

For programming assignments, the Editor is where youâ€™ll fix the existing code or write your own code from scratch. This code will be checked.

  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
</style>

To run your code at any time, choose the Run option from the context menu or press <span style="color: #509DD6">&shortcut:Run;</span>:

If you want to go back to the Editor and focus on your code, the fastest way to do it is with the Hide All Windows command (<span style="color: #509DD6">&shortcut:HideAllWindows;</span>). To get all the windows back, repeat the command.
