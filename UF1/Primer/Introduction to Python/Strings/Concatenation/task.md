## Concatenation

Remember that some arithmetic operations can also apply to non-numeric types?
Combining two strings using the `+` symbol is called concatenation.  
  
Use the `hello` and `world` variables to get a string `"Hello World"`.  

<div class='hint'>Use chained concatenation and a single-space string <code>" "</code>.</div>
